	s closed for renovation.\n\n#37 HOW TO PRACTICE? features the four founder
	s of Hulias: MADS JOHN THOMSETH\, JØRN AAGAARD\, ØYVIND BAST and ISAK WISL
	ØFF.\n\nLocated in an underground vault in central Oslo\, Hulias is an art
	ist-run space that promotes spatially oriented contemporary art. The found
	ers of Hulias want to give the exhibiting artist more freedom to experimen
	t through a direct dialogue with the space itself. The programming focuses
	 on spatial/bodily practices such as sculpture\, installation\, performanc
	e\, audio/visual\, light and smell.\n\nFor the 37th edition of HOW TO PRAC
	TICE?\, the founders of Hulias introduce the organisation and discuss thei
	r concept of making a fluid space for contemporary art that is supported b
	y a democratic structure. They also share insights from their experiences 
	as artists who curate.\n\nHulias was established in 2020 by four visual ar
	tists: Mads John Thomseth (b.1987\, NO)\, Jørn Aagaard (b.1989\, NO)\, Øyv
	ind Bast (b.1989\, NO) and Isak Wisløff (b.1989\, NO).\n\nThis talk is spo
	ken in Scandinavian languages or English\, depending on the audience’s wis
	hes.\n\nHulias is located in a basement with heavy reverberation. We will 
	do our best to find a good spot to talk\, but please be aware that acousti
	cs might be challenging. Unfortunately\, this event is not wheelchair acce
